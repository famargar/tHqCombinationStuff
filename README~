limitPLOT.C produced the limit plot on the single top plus Higgs production cross section, as a function of the Higgs to diphoton branching ratio.
The macro uses recent C++ features; it thus needs to be compiled with proper compiler (gccROOT on my machine) and the resulting a.out binary to be execturd to produce the output limitPLOT.pdf

plotLimits_tHqcombo.py is a python script that produced the limits on the Ct=-1 hypothesis, split per channel. The script needs a version of ROOT that allows interface with Python. In my case, I simply ran it on lxplus as my local machine does not have ROOT with Python support.

The RootFiles folder contains the root files needed to run the limits, and are common to both the limits on Ct and the limits on tHq cross section

The CtLimits folder contains the datacard used to compute the limits on Ct

The XsecLimits folder contains the datacards used to compute the limits on the tHq cross sections
